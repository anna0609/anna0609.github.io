Here's one example of coding Type I error simulation for 100 samples:
```{r message=FALSE}
set.seed(99)
n.sample2 <- 100
#Sample indices
sample.indices <- list()
n = 0
se = 15/sqrt(20)
for (i in 1:n.sample2) {
  sample2 <- rnorm(20, mean = 120, sd = 15)
sample2_mean = mean(sample2)
z_stats <- (sample2_mean-120)/se
z_crit <- qnorm(0.05)
if(z_stats >= z_crit) {
  #print("0")
} else {
  #print("1 Type I Error")
  n = n + 1
}
}
percentage = n/100
print(percentage)
```
