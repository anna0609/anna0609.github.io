I am a first year MS biostatistics student at Columbia University


## coding and statistics

I love data science and statistics, especially machine learning and hypothesis tests.

Here's my t-test example:
```{r message=FALSE}
sample = rnorm(20, mean = 120, sd = 15)
t.test(sample, mu=120)
t_critical = qt(0.05,19)
```
